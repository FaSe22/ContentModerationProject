This project is the attempt to build a page where users can share content.
This content can either be a blogpost or a tweet.

The challenge is: There should be a content-moderation package.

Both blogposts and tweets should go through content moderation. 
Their content can be moderated valid or invalid. 
Valid content should be displayed, invalid content should be replaced by some sort of fallback.

The package comes with permission: content-moderator. Only users with that permission should be
able to perform crud operations on the Content Moderation class.

Develop by using TDD.
